Lotería Game - README
Overview
This is a web-based version of the traditional Mexican Lotería game. It includes two main components:

Lotería Cards for players (students)
Playing Deck for the teacher or caller to call out the cards.
The game can be played on any modern web browser. The main HTML file for this game is Index.html.

Game Setup
Files:
Index.html - Main page to select whether you are a player (student) or the caller (teacher).
Image Files Folder - Contains images used for the Lotería cards and the playing deck. These images can be replaced with custom images if needed.
Lotería Card - Players use a randomized Lotería card to mark off called cards.
Playing Deck - The teacher/caller uses this to call out randomized cards from the deck.
How to Play:
1. Open Index.html in a web browser:
This will give you the option to select either:

Lotería Card: Students/Players use this option to receive their unique card.
Playing Deck: Teachers/Callers use this to shuffle and call out cards.
2. Player (Student) Setup:
Choose the Lotería Card option to generate a unique Lotería card.
As the caller announces the cards, players mark off the corresponding images on their card.
3. Caller (Teacher) Setup:
Choose the Playing Deck option to randomly generate Lotería cards to announce to the players.
The cards will be shown one at a time in a shuffled order.
Image Customization:
Replacing Images:
All images used in the Lotería cards and playing deck are located in the Images Folder.
To replace an image:
Open the image folder in your project directory.
Replace the existing image file with your desired image.
Ensure the new image has the same file name and format (e.g., .jpg or .png) as the original image to avoid breaking the game functionality.
If you wish to add entirely new images, you will need to update the HTML and JavaScript files to reference the new image paths and names.
Game Rules:
The goal for players is to mark off a row, column, diagonal, or other pre-defined pattern on their Lotería card.
The first player to complete a winning pattern shouts "¡Lotería!" to win the game.
Customization:
In addition to image replacement, you can also customize the game layout and functionality by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Explore the code to add new features, adjust card layout, or change game mechanics.

Enjoy your game of Lotería!
